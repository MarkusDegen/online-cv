    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a versatile professional with a rich background in software development, 
      including roles as a Scrum Master, QA Engineer, and Product Owner. 
      I excel in team coordination, product management, and ensuring high quality in software products.
      
      In my journey, I have developed strong skills in agile methodologies as a Scrum Master and 
      in ensuring software quality as a QA Engineer. As a Product Owner, 
      I've effectively combined these skills to oversee product development, 
      aligning team efforts with market demands and user needs.
      
      My passion for knowledge sharing led me to coach in test-driven development, 
      where I have trained teams to enhance their skills and adopt best practices. 
      Additionally, I have been instrumental in creating and nurturing a learning community, 
      fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement among peers.
      
      With a keen interest in machine learning, I have pursued several courses to integrate 
      AI and ML insights into product strategy. My goal is to continue evolving as a 
      Product Owner, leveraging my diverse skills and machine learning knowledge to 
      innovate and lead in the ever-changing tech landscape.
